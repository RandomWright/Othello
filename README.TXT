Charlotte Wright, MW 4:50-6:05, MW 12:30-13:45, Wilfred Wallis, Project 3. Spring 2015.

1. A one paragraph description of your class designs

I use the model - controller - view  class design.
The model holds all the important information like the board, discs, and players.
The controller takes the input from the GUI and translates it to the model.
The view is the GUIs.


2. A description of the fundamental, original changes that you made to the rules of your
game. Cosmetic changes do not count?.

My custom rule is that a player can remove a piece by clicking on it as a turn.


3. A one paragraph description of your testing strategy.


I had small tests class for my model and my MasterMind test that tests everything I had coded up till then.
Some of my MasterMind tests no longer worked after improvements to the code but they were useful as the time.
I also had a lot of print statements to see what is going on.


4. Detailed instructions on how to compile and run your application and your tests. This
should include command line arguments (if any), appropriate responses to any
prompts, and instructions for using your GUI.

Compile all the code.
The start run my program, run the Start class in the GUI package.


5. Instructions describing how to play your game.


First you enter Player 1's name
enter Player 2's name
Choose if you want normal or custom rules

Play Othello
-Black goes first
-Click on spaces, it will tell you if the move is legal
-Rules button brings up the rules of the games
-Check Legal Moves - sees if there are legal move left, if there are no moves left it will end the game
-End Game, this ends the game and sees who wins


6. Full documentation for any enhancements that you wish to be considered for extra
credit. YOU must explain what your enhancements are, and how the TA should
enable them or otherwise detect their presence.


Possible extra credit enhancements a Enum for the Rows, A to H and/or a binary tree / binary search to find which square the user pressed.
